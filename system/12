# Figure out the exact size of each folder of /var in a humanly understandable way
# followed by the path of it.

sudo du -sh /var/*



# du (disc usage) command estimates file_path space usage
# The options -sh are (from man du):

#  -s, --summarize
          display only a total for each argument

#  -h, --human-readable
#         print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)

# To check more than one directory and see the total, use du -sch:

#  -c, --total
#         produce a grand total
