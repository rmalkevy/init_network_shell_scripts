# What file contains the RSA keys of systems that are authorized to connect via SSH?

~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# When you create a new user, the ~/.ssh directory is not created him by default.
# You have create it. Then you have to create ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file where you will copy the public key.

# On your server, check whether ~/.ssh or ~/.ssh/authorized_keys exists.
# Looking at hte error you have, it seems that it does not. So manualy create it.

# BTW, ~ in above statement means User's home directory.
# So if you have user called user1, then it would be /home/user1/.ssh or /home/user1/.ssh/authorized_keys
