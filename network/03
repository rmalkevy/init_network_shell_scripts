# Identify the MAC address of the Wi-Fi card

ifconfig en1 | awk '/ether/{print $2}'

# en1        -> name of Wi-Fi card
# awk 	     -> is used to print something
# /ether/ 	 -> pattern which have to match in line
# {print $2} -> print only second word in line


# For information and education

# This is the same as:
# ifconfig en1 | grep ether | cut -f 2 -d " "

# $0         -> print all line
