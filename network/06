# Get the complete path of the file that contains the IP address of the DNS server
# youâ€™re using

echo /var/run/resolv.conf

# Deduction
# Many of sources said that path to file that contain the IP adress of the DNS server is /etc/resolv.conf
# but if you do this ls -l /etc/resolv.conf
# you will get something like this -> lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  22 Oct 11  2017 /etc/resolv.conf -> ../var/run/resolv.conf
# That means that /etc/resolv.conf path is only symbolic link (pointer to another file)

# to see guts of the file use  -> cat /etc/resolv.conf
# 						   or
# 							   -> cat /var/run/resolv.conf
